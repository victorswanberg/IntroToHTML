<!-- The objective is to create an HTML table <table>-->

<body>
<!-- Note most styling is done with CSS now we do not use inline html styling anymore this is just to show you a border. -->
<table border="1">
	<!-- <tr> element is a row -->
	<tr> 
	<!-- <td> element is what is inside the table. Think of td being each cell. -->
		<td>Red</td>
		<td>Orange</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Green</td>
		<td>Yellow</td>
	</tr>	
</table>
<br>
<!-- Lets create a table about people. Name and Age -->
<!-- <th> is for table header. 
Name 	Age
============
Vic		30
Aaron	27
 -->
<table border="1">
	<tr>
		<th>Name</th>
		<th>Age</th>
	</tr>
	<tr> 
		<td>Vic</td>
		<td>30</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Aaron</td>
		<td>27</td>
	</tr>	
</table>

<!-- HTML is all about mark up that is meaningful so lets create another table with a little more meaning.
The last table has table rows but there is no difference between the table rows with the header and the table rows with the data. 
For example someone with a screen reader may see the information differently so we want to make sure that all the elements we are calling have meaning. 

The next two elements we are going to use is:
<thead>
<tbody>
-->
<br>

<table border="1">
	<tr>
		<thead>
			<th>Name</th>
			<th>Age</th>
			<th>Gender</th>
		</thead>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<tbody> 
			<td>Vic</td>
			<td>30</td>
			<td>Male</td>
		</tbody>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<tbody>
			<td>Aaron</td>
			<td>27</td>
			<td>Male</td>
		</tbody>
	</tr>	
</table>
